# Gym ChatBot 
-----------------------
## Project Description 
A gym chatbot system that responds to client reviews and answer questions about the gym. The system will be able to produce relevant questions for the client and will even respond to any questions posed by the user in order to act as a communication line between the gym management and their clients. 

### Usage
Upon running, the system will produce a simple chatbox GUI in which the user can begin communicating with the chat bot. The chat bot will respond to general forms of greetings (better responses and understanding than previous iteration) and prompt the user to leave a review. At any point the user can ask questions regarding; payment, location and conatct details of the gym. The chatbot will identify these questions and provide useful information to the user.
