# Gym ChatBot 
-----------------------
## Project Description 
A gym chatbot system that responds to client satisfaction, complaints, and reviews. The system will be able to produce relevant questions for the client and will even respond to any questions posed by the user in order to act as a communication line between the gym management and their clients. The chatbot will also provide useful data to the gym which will allow the management to decide on changes/improvements to the gym. 

### How to Use the Project
Upon running, the system will display an empty output allowing the user to decide how they want to greet the bot. The bot will them prompt the user to leave a review. The bot will then respond to the user's review depending 
on the nature of the review (positive or negative).
