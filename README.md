# Gym ChatBot 
-----------------------
## Project Description 
A gym chatbot system that responds to client reviews and answer questions about the gym. The system will be able to produce relevant questions for the client and will even respond to any questions posed by the user in order to act as a communication line between the gym management and their clients. 

### Usage
Upon running, the system will produce a simple chatbox GUI in which the user can begin communicating with the chat bot.
